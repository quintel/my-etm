      title: Data collection
      description: |
        This website collects e-mail addresses for the purpose of logging into the website, so that users
        can load and save scenarios. Other than for this purpose, the addresses in question are stored and
        used exclusively to inform the users of available updates and new versions of the Energy Transition
        Model if the user agreed to be informed when signing up.
        <br/><br/>
        The data the Energy Transition Model sends from users' personal computers (PCs) to the web server
        (among others www.energytransitionmodel.com) are anonymous (i.e., they do not contain e-mail
        addresses or other data that can be used to identify the user) and cannot be linked in any way to
        the previously stored e-mail-addresses. The data the Energy Transition Model sends from users' PCs
        to the web server do include the IP-addresses of these PCs. IP-addresses can be logged in order to
        prevent users from sending data several times and corrupting the energy statistics. The Energy
        Transition Model only sends data after the user gives explicit permission to do so. The data sent
        from a user's PC consists of all model parameters set by the user and possibly the title of a saved
        scenario.
        <br/><br/>
        The server logs and databases are used for locating problems on the web server and are accessible to
        the police and other judicial authorities both in- and outside the Netherlands.

      title: About Quintel
      description: |
        Quintel aims to accelerate the energy transition with state-of-the-art and
        open-source tools and data. We do this in collaboration with our partners.
        In addition to our continuous development of the ETM, we help grid operators,
        policy makers, consultants, and many others to use and apply the ETM.

    open_source:
      title: Open source
      description: |
        At Quintel we strongly believe that sharing knowledge and a collaborative approach can greatly
        accelerate the energy transition. Therefore, we offer the ETM as a fully open-source tool. This
        means that anyone can access, review, and improve the data, calculations, definitions, and software
        that is part of the model.
        </br>
        </br>
        While the ETM is created and developed by Quintel, it is made possible thanks to the work of
        thousands of contributors to open-source projects such as Ruby on Rails, Backbone, React, and many
        more. Icons and images used in the ETM are thanks to Hero Icons, Font Awesome, and Freepik
        (Flaticon).

    development:
      title: Development process
      description: |
        The modelling principles and the data underlying the ETM are continuously maintained and improved by
        Quintel to match the ever-changing needs of the energy transition. These needs are indicated in part
        by our users, who can propose changes on any part of the model due to its open-source nature.
        </br>
        </br>
        Additionally, these needs come from our extensive network of partners, who we collaborate with in
        development projects. Do you have any suggestions for model improvements?

    partners:
      title: Partners
      description: |
        The expansion and improvement of the ETM fully depends on (the continuous) support from partners.
        Over the years many grid operators, government parties, consultancies, universities, and knowledge
        institutes have actively contributed knowledge and resources making sure the ETM remains a leading
        open-source tool. Are you interested in collaborating to expand or improve the ETM?
