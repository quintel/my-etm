        This scenario has been affected by the recent October update of the municipal and regional datasets
        from start year 2019 to 2023. As a result, the outcomes of the scenario might have changed. It is
        recommended to review the scenario outcomes and possibly transfer the scenario to a stable version
        of the ETM, where the 2019 start year will remain available.
